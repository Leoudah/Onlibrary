                "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.
                 He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike
                  brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was
                   about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved
                    helplessly before his eyes."

                With it's startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece,
                 The Metamorphosis. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes 
                 an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing—though
                  absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its 
                  place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction. As W.H. Auden wrote, "Kafka 
                  is important to us because his predicament is the predicament of modern man."
