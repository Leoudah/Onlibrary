                A pilot stranded in the desert awakes one morning to see, standing before him, the most extraordinary little fellow. 
                "Please," asks the stranger, "draw me a sheep." And the pilot realizes that when life's events are too difficult to
                 understand, there is no choice but to succumb to their mysteries. He pulls out pencil and paper... And thus begins 
                 this wise and enchanting fable that, in teaching the secret of what is really important in life, has changed forever
                  the world for its readers.
